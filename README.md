#Get your monthly Videotron Internet usage

* This extension display the monthly usage for the current billing period in the toolbar. 
* A tooltip with the billing period dates popup on mouse over. 
* The data are automatically fetched from the Videotron website every hour (but Videotron update the data only a few times a day). 
* A click on the icon force a refresh. But be careful, too many request seems to trigger some "protection" and the returned value become 0 for a certain period of time .

You must set your user id (VLxxxxxx) in the config. Then save, and click on the icon in the toolbar to force a refresh.

This extension is very basic and any change in the Videotron web page template can break the extension.
